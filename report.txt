Miniproject-4 Report

-   In your own words, briefly explain the purpose of the experiment
    and the experimental setup. Be sure to clearly state on which
    machine you ran the experiments, and exactly what your command line
    arguments were, so that we can reproduce your work in case of
    any confusion.

The experiment of the purpose was to introduce multithreading using mandelbrot set computation to optimize it.
It shows how it can help break processes up and shows how vastly helpful it is.
I ran the program on:
Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS x64 bit Virtual Machine
gcc version 9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)

The exact command line arguments I entered were: 
	time ./mandel -x -.5 -y .5 -s 1 -m 2000 -n (# threads)
	time ./mandel -x 0.2869325 -y 0.0142905 -s .000001 -W 1024 -H 1024 -m 1000 -n (# threads)


-   For the following two configurations, measure and graph the
    execution time of your  multithreaded `mandel` using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    10, 50, and 100 threads. The execution time of these experiments may 
    be upset by other things going on in the machine. So, repeat each
    measurement five times, and use the fastest time achieved.

    - a) time ./mandel -x -.5 -y .5 -s 1 -m 2000 -n

    - b) time ./mandel -x 0.2869325 -y 0.0142905 -s .000001 -W 1024 -H 1024 -m 1000 -n

-   Explain the shape of the two curves. 
    What is the optimal number of threads? 
    Why do curves A and B have a different shape? 

The shape for A is a more zoomed-out picture of the mandelbrot set, and the B image is zoomed-in quite a bit into a feature, these are controlled by the user inputs and can be manipulated however the user wants. 

The optimal number of threads for A is 10, while B is 50. Both were ran 5 times using "time ./mandel ..." to measure.

A and B have such a different shape because of the design of the mandelbrot set shows that the more you zoom into the image, the more patterns and designs you will see, I also watched numberphile's video on youtube to see more about it and it was quite interesting.
